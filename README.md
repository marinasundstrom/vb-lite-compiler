Visual Basic Compiler
==

This compiler was built for a compiler construction course during my studies at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH).

I have learned lots from this project (just one compiler among many). Much can, of course, be further improved and learnt from this project.


* Written in C#.
* Targets .NET 4.0 Client Profile
* Generates modules and functions that can be executed.
* Code design and structure is inspired by Mono C# compiler.
* Expression parser logic is inspired from the IronPython compiler.

Run the Test project.
